This is a playground for manually experimenting with the MonitorModel component and seeing how it behaves.
A good way to find bugs and doing some sanity checking.

TODO: It could probably later be used by qmlauto tests as a way to ensure it's always kept in a healthy state
and also as a way to manually reproduce what an automated test does.

To run it simply do this from a terminal window:
$ /path/to/your/bin/appman main.qml
