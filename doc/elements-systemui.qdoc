elements, thereby creating a parent-child relationship between the two elements.

  \li ApplicationInstaller - The package installation/removal/update part of the application-manager.
  \li WindowManager - The window model and controller.

  \li SystemMonitor - The system monitoring model, giving access to a range of measurements, e.g.
      cpu-load, frames-per-second, etc.
\endlist
